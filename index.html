  <p>Hi, my name is C</p>
  <p>I started studying digital media because I had a passion for front end design and wanted to persue UX/UI for my career</p>
  <p>I spend a lot of time playing games, listening to music, creating art and playing with my dog</p>
  <p>My favourite emoji is âœ¨ or ðŸª¼</p>
  <p>My personal experience with sound is mostly through my love for music. I love all genres and styles of music. I have also completed a module in sound design last year, however I found out i am practically tonedeaf and did struggle so it isn't my strong suit. <!-- elaborate as much as you like --></p>
  <p>I have some prior experience working with code, mostly with Java / Javascript in my IT course and Interactive Media. It is a passion of mine to learn coding and I have an interest in it so I am excited to persue this class!<!-- elaborate as much as you like --></p>
